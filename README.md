The following code is from my research at the University of Michigan Big Data Science Institute. The purpose of the code is to run selective inference on a dataset consisting of gene expression data (pathway.scores), imaging data(pc_scores), and survival time data (Y) for patients with Low-Grade Glioma (LGG). The gene expression data consists of expression levels for different gene pathways and the imaging data consists of principal components of scans of patients' brains. Step 1 splits the data into different train/test splits, from 90/10 to 50/50, due to the small sample size of the data. Step 2 implements an ensemble method of forward selection, boruta, and LASSO bootstrapped to select which gene pathways are heavily correlated with the imaging data, and assigns each gene pathway a score based on how often it is selected by the ensemble method. Step 2.5 regresses the survival time data on the gene pathway data, using LASSO to select gene pathways strongly associated with survival time based on how many times the gene pathways were selected in Step 2. This is meant to select gene pathways that are associated with survival time through associations with the imaging data. Step 3 runs ridge regression, regressing survival time data on the selected gene pathway data to test for significance.
